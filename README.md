## Documentation

**Please go here for documentation on setting up and using GUMs: [https://generalusermodels.github.io/gum/](https://generalusermodels.github.io/gum/)**

### Note for setting up GUM

You will need either API key for the model you want to use or to set up the SGLang Server on the GPU server, which can be accessed by your local Mac machine. As our tool is built upon GUM, our tool currently only runs on MacOS systems and is not compatible with other OS due to a python dependancy for recording the screen that only works on macOS.
